## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Create an empty folder in your preferred location on your computer
* create a virtual environment in that virtual environment using python3.6.
  ```bash
    python3.6 -m venv virtenv
  ```

* Install the dependecies listed in requirements.txt file
  ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Choose the database of your choice to connect to the app. Personally I used postgres for this project.
* If you choose to use postgres, you'll need to install the CLI for postgres then go to you terminal and create a database for the app.
* To connect to postgres
  '''bash
    psql
  '''
* To create the database
  '''bash
    CREATE DATABASE <name_of_database>
  '''
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
